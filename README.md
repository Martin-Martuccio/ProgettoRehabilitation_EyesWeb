# Rehabilitation Application Using EyesWeb

This project was developed as part of the [Multimodal Systems](https://corsi.unige.it/en/off.f/2024/ins/77859) course at the University of Genoa. The objective is to create a rehabilitation application that measures, in real-time, the variation in the positions of the user's bounding rectangle edges.

## Project Overview

The application calculates the variation of the left and right edges of the user's bounding rectangle using the EyesWeb XMI platform. Significant variations trigger a visual feedback: the left side of the background changes from black to red for high left edge variations, and the right side does the same for the right edge.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the user's movements.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides immediate visual cues based on movement intensity.
- **Customizable Sampling Period**: Default set to 40 ms, adjustable as needed.

## Installation

1. **Download EyesWeb XMI**: Obtain the latest version from the [EyesWeb website](https://casapaganini.unige.it/eyesweb_bp).
2. **Install EyesWeb XMI**: Follow the provided installation instructions.
3. **Clone This Repository**: Use `git clone [repository URL]` to download the project files.
4. **Open the Project**: Launch EyesWeb XMI and load the provided project file.

## Usage

1. **Connect Input Devices (or Video input)**: Ensure compatible sensors (e.g., motion capture systems, cameras) are properly connected.
2. **Run the Application**: Start the project within EyesWeb XMI.
3. **Observe Visual Feedback**: Monitor the background color changes corresponding to movement variations.

## Future Work and Real-World Applications

Potential enhancements and applications include:

- **Integration with Additional Sensors**: Incorporate devices like wearable motion sensors for comprehensive movement analysis.
- **Personalized Rehabilitation Programs**: Adapt the system to individual patient needs, offering tailored feedback.
- **Clinical Trials**: Validate the system's effectiveness in real-world rehabilitation settings.
- **Expansion to Other Therapies**: Apply the platform to various therapeutic areas, such as post-stroke recovery or sports injury rehabilitation.
